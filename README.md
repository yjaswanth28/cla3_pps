LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE:

To make a library management system for handling of data and managing day to day operations.

PROBLEM DEFINITION:

PURPOSE OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE:

●The purpose of a library management system is to manage the functioning of a library with efficiency and reduced costs. Automation of tasks reduces the amount of manual work required.

●We can use programs for issuing books, keeping track of issues, cataloging, indexing, checking availability and implementation of fines.This also minimizes the chances of errors.

● The system is handy and easy to use for both officials and students.We can also enhance this system with more features such as an entry record, and to store e-books. Overall,the system can be modified as per needs of the institution.
